<h1>Welcome to the <?=$config['orgName']?> Certificate Authority</h1>

<p>You are probably here because someone gave you this URL and told you to get a certificate thing-a-ma-jig. Right?</p>

<p>Well no worries, because it all sounds a lot harder than it actually is.</p>

<p>Basically there are two steps involved in getting your new certificate, and they are:<br/>
<ul>
	<li> Validate your identity<br/><br/>
	Basically this step is all about making sure that you are you by sending an email to your mailbox, and getting you to tell me the secret that I put in there.<br/><br/>
	If you can do that, then I will know for sure who you are, and then I can give you a certificate.<br/><br/>
	
	<li> Get your certificate<br/><br/>
	In order to get your certificate, your browser will need to generate a key, this will involve you having to click some buttons when your browser asks you some questions.<br/><br/>
	Don't worry though, I will help you through this process. It's pretty easy!<br/>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
So, if you want to get started, let's go now!<br/>
