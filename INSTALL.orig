Installation instructions are still a little hazy here...

Prerequisites:
 -	A Windows / Linux / FreeBSD operating system.
 -	An installed and working Apache web server. (others may work)
 -	An installed and working PHP module for the Apache server.
 -	The OpenSSL extention compiled in or dynamically linked into PHP.
If you want to support Netscape SPKAC Client Certificates:
 -	OpenSSL command line tool. (optional)
If you want people with old versions of IE to work:
 -  xenroll.dll specifically version 5.131.3659.0 (optional)
 		Place this file in the certcontrol directory.
		See the file ./certcontrol/README for more info.
	
Basically:
 -	Dump the project into a web accessible directory
 -	Set up the environment variable OPENSSL_CONF to point to the
	directory that the webfiles are in + "/openssl/openssl.conf"
		(If you are using Windows, you will need to set this
		in Control Panel/System and reboot, Unix users can get
		away with a SetEnv in the httpd.conf)
 -	Recursively change ownership (to the web user) of:
 		./openssl
		./config

Goto the main page and do the initial configuration for the CA.
